# GLM Bridge — Z.AI Proxy API

An OpenAI- **and Anthropic-compatible** API proxy for [chat.z.ai](https://chat.z.ai). Drop it in front of any OpenAI/Anthropic-compatible tool and use Z.AI's GLM models — pure HTTP, no browser automation at runtime.

**Hosted instance:** `https://glm.cognix.sryze.cc/v1` — auth `Waguri` (Bearer or `x-api-key`), runs agent mode, supports `glm-5.2` and `glm-5.3-flash`. OpenAI endpoint recommended; Anthropic works but is primitive.

---

## Features

- **Dual protocol** — OpenAI `/v1/chat/completions` + Anthropic `/v1/messages` on one server; streaming (SSE, 5 s keep-alive pings) and non-streaming
- **Pure HTTP** — no Playwright/Selenium/browser at runtime; HTTP/2 + pooled connections; pure-Go SQLite (`modernc.org/sqlite`, no CGO)
- **Vision (image input)** — images on both endpoints (OpenAI `image_url` parts, Anthropic `image` blocks; URL or base64). Each is downloaded/decoded, uploaded to Z.AI's file endpoint, and attached exactly like the official web client. **10 images / 50 MB each** per request. Requires `ZAI_TOKEN` (guest sessions get `401`)
- **Throwaway sessions (context-rot guard)** — every request's chat is deleted on Z.AI (`DELETE /api/v1/chats/{chat_id}`) the moment its response completes, so no history outlives a request and the account never accumulates dead sessions
- **Async session pool (default)** — a standing batch of pre-made sessions (`SESSION_POOL_SIZE`, default 5) is kept ready; requests grab one instantly and each consumed session is deleted + replaced, so the batch refills itself. `--sync-mode` restores the legacy per-request flow
- **Agent mode** — translates OpenAI tools/roles into the user-only prompt Z.AI's endpoint accepts, then rewrites the model's `<<<TOOL_CALL>>>` blocks back into native `tool_calls` (OpenAI) / `tool_use` (Anthropic). Modern XML-sectioned shim (default, `<already_called>` anti-loop section included) + legacy `[ROLE: ...]` shim (opt-in)
- **Per-model feature resolution** — resolved from Z.AI server capabilities with stored per-model overrides; `image_generation` is **always forced `false`**; `reasoning_effort` (`high`/`max`) forwarded only when the model supports it (forces `enable_thinking=true`)
- **Live model list** — full catalog from Z.AI `/api/models` (cached 5 min, static fallback) with OpenAI-style `architecture`/modality on `/v1/models`
- **Token pool** — device tokens harvested via `cmd/token-collector` into `tokens.sqlite`, consumed FIFO and deleted after use (up to 5 retries per captcha)
- **Background captcha cache** — with agent mode on, captcha params are pre-generated asynchronously (2 cached, 75 s TTL, auto-pauses after 3 min idle)
- **Graceful shutdown** — CTRL+C/SIGTERM drains in-flight requests (10 s), then deletes every remaining pooled session on Z.AI before exiting (second CTRL+C force-exits)

---

## Supported Models

Models are fetched live from Z.AI's `/api/models` (cached 5 min). The server keeps models from the newest down to `glm-4.7` (inclusive). The fallback list (used if Z.AI is unreachable) is:

| Model ID | Notes |
|---|---|
| `glm-5.3-flash` | Lightweight flagship, premium quality, instant response |
| `glm-5.3` | Flagship, excels at coding and long-horizon tasks |
| `glm-5.2` | Previous flagship |
| `GLM-5.1` | Older flagship |
| `GLM-5-Turbo` | Chat, coding, and agentic tasks |
| `GLM-5v-Turbo` | Vision model |
| `glm-4.7` | Classic high-performance model |

Each `/v1/models` entry carries an OpenAI-style `architecture` object derived from server capabilities (`info.meta.capabilities`); vision models (`"vision": true`) advertise image input:

```json
{
  "id": "GLM-5v-Turbo",
  "object": "model",
  "created": 1774521032,
  "owned_by": "z-ai",
  "display_name": "GLM-5V-Turbo",
  "description": "Vision model with evolved intelligence",
  "architecture": {
    "modality": "text+image->text",
    "input_modalities": ["text", "image"],
    "output_modalities": ["text"]
  }
}
```

Text-only models report `"modality": "text->text"` / `"input_modalities": ["text"]`; `output_modalities` is always `["text"]`.

> **Notes:**
> - No `model` in the request body → defaults to `glm-5`.
> - Guest session (no `ZAI_TOKEN`) typically only allows `glm-5.3-flash` and `glm-4.7` — use `glm-4.7` for fast tokenless testing.
> - `/models` (plural) returns `{ models: [...], currentModel: "glm-5.2" }` for clients expecting that shape.

## Getting `ZAI_TOKEN` (optional, but recommended)

`ZAI_TOKEN` is a Z.AI JWT. Setting it skips guest initialization and unlocks all models (and vision uploads).

1. Log in at **https://chat.z.ai**, open DevTools (`F12`) → **Application → Local Storage → https://chat.z.ai** → copy the value of key **`token`** (or run `localStorage.getItem('token')` in the Console).
2. Export it before starting the server:

   ```bash
   export ZAI_TOKEN="paste-the-copied-jwt-here"        # Linux / macOS
   $env:ZAI_TOKEN="paste-the-copied-jwt-here"          # Windows PowerShell
   ```

---

## Getting Started

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/izaart95-jpg/GLM-Free-API/ zai-api && cd zai-api

# 2. Initialize the Go module (repo ships without go.mod by design)
go mod init zai-api && go mod tidy

# 3. Optional: playwright deps (only for the token collector, when deps are missing)
npx playwright install-deps

# 4. Generate the token database
go run ./cmd/token-collector

# 5. Start the server
go run .
```

For better performance build first: `go build -o zai-api -trimpath -gcflags="all=-l=4" -ldflags="-s -w" . && ./zai-api` (same pattern for `./cmd/token-collector`).

On startup a banner shows the health URL, endpoints, and auth token. The Z.AI session initializes asynchronously — if guest init fails, the first chat request retries it.

| `--session-reuse-count` | `10` | How many requests one chat session serves before it is deleted on Z.AI and replaced (`1` = throwaway per request) |

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `3001` | HTTP port |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address |
| `AUTH_TOKEN` | `Waguri` | Bearer / `x-api-key` token for client auth |
| `TIMEOUT` | `300000` | Request timeout (ms) |
| `ZAI_TOKEN` | *(empty)* | Hardcoded Z.AI JWT — skips guest initialization |
| `AGENT_MODE` | `false` | Enable agent mode (`1`/`true`/`yes`/`on`/`modern` → modern shim, `legacy` → legacy shim) |
| `AGENT_MODE_VARIANT` | `modern` | Shim variant override (`modern`/`legacy`; takes precedence over `AGENT_MODE`'s implicit variant) |
| `AGENT_MODE_LEVEL` | *(empty)* | Agent repair level (`ultra` enables ToolParserLLM repair; requires `AGENT_MODE`) |
| `FORCE_CPU` / `TOOLPARSER_LLM_FORCE_CPU` | `false` | Accept the degraded CPU inference path for ToolParserLLM ultra mode on GPU-less hosts |
| `TOOLPARSER_LLM_CACHE_DIR` | OS cache / `./models/toolparser-llm` | Where the base-model reference and LoRA bundle are cached |
| `TOOLPARSER_LLM_LORA_URL` | public Kaggle dataset zip | Override for the LoRA bundle download (adapter weights + config) |
| `TOOLPARSER_LLM_LORA_PATH` | *(empty)* | Local LoRA bundle override: directory containing `adapter_model.safetensors` + `adapter_config.json`, or a zip file (skips download; air-gapped friendly) |
| `TOOLPARSER_LLM_BASE_PATH` | *(empty)* | Local base-model snapshot dir (unset = resolve `Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct` via SGLang/HF) |
| `TOOLPARSER_LLM_SGLANG_ADDR` | `127.0.0.1:30000` | Address the SGLang server is started on / reached at |
| `TOOLPARSER_LLM_LORA_SHA256` | *(empty)* | Optional pinned SHA256 for the downloaded LoRA zip (mismatch aborts) |

| `TOOLPARSER_LLM_PYTHON` | `python3` | Python executable used to launch SGLang |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `debug` | `debug` dumps every Z.AI request/response, SSE lines, and headers |
| `LOG_FORMAT` | `text` | Log format |

| `SYNC_MODE` | `false` | Synchronous session flow (one sticky reused chat, no pre-warmed pool) |
| `SESSION_POOL_SIZE` | `5` | Standing batch of ready chat sessions |
| `SESSION_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT` | `10` | Seconds to wait for a pooled session before creating one directly (`0` = wait forever) |
| `SESSION_REUSE_COUNT` | `10` | Requests served per chat session before delete + replace (`1` = throwaway per request; reuse looks human and avoids WAF bot flags) |
| `UPSTREAM_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` | *(random 200–500)* | Minimum gap between consecutive requests to Z.AI / Aliyun — paces bursts so the Aliyun WAF doesn't block the egress IP (issue #20). The gap is enforced by **one shared gate across all upstream transports** (Z.AI + Aliyun captcha), so alternating calls between the two cannot collapse the real inter-request gap to zero (issue #41). Default is drawn randomly in `[200, 500]` ms per transport (a fixed gap is a fingerprint); `0` disables pacing |
| `TOKEN_COUNT_TTL_MS` | `5000` | How long the `/health` token count stays cached before the next probe re-queries the active database (`TOKEN_COUNT_TTL_MS <= 0` keeps the default) |

---

## Session Lifecycle — Reused Sessions & the Session Pool

OpenAI-compatible clients are **stateless** — they re-send the whole conversation every request, and the bridge forwards it inside a `chat_id` that materializes server-side. Leaving those chats behind would fill the account with dead sessions, and one-chat-per-message looks like bot behaviour to the Aliyun WAF (IP block). So each session is **reused up to `SESSION_REUSE_COUNT` (default 10) requests** — one chat carrying several turns, like a human — then deleted via `DELETE /api/v1/chats/{chat_id}` and replaced. Deletion is idempotent — Z.AI's `{"detail":"We could not find what you're looking for :/"}` counts as success. Reuse is safe: verified e2e that isolated single-turn payloads build no server-side history on a shared `chat_id`.

- Clients never see the `chat_id`; their state lives entirely in their own `messages` array, so reuse/rotation is invisible.

**Async mode (default):** at startup the bridge pre-makes `SESSION_POOL_SIZE` (5) sessions. Requests acquire one instantly; if a burst exhausts the batch, waiters give up after `SESSION_ACQUIRE_TIMEOUT` (10 s) and create a session directly. Each pooled session is stocked straight back into the batch until it hits `SESSION_REUSE_COUNT`, then deleted + replaced. Z.AI chat IDs are client-generated UUIDs (a chat only materializes on first completion), so warmup is instant/local and unconsumed sessions never touch the account.

**Sync mode:** `--sync-mode` / `SYNC_MODE=true` — one sticky chat is reused up to `SESSION_REUSE_COUNT`, then deleted + rotated; no pre-warming.

**Graceful shutdown:** CTRL+C/SIGTERM stops accepting connections, drains in-flight responses (10 s), prints `clearing all remaining sessions...`, deletes every still-pooled session (or the sticky sync session) on Z.AI, then exits. A second CTRL+C force-exits.

**Observability:** `GET /status` reports pool state: `{ "mode": "async", "reuse": true, "maxUses": 10, "gc_enabled": true, "size": 5, "ready": 5 }`.

## API Reference

### OpenAI-Compatible

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/v1/chat/completions` | ✅ | Chat completions (streaming + non-streaming) |
| `GET`  | `/v1/models` | ✅ | OpenAI-style model list |
| `GET`  | `/models` | ✅ | Compact `{ models, currentModel }` shape |

### Anthropic-Compatible

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POST` | `/v1/messages` | ✅ | Anthropic Messages API (streaming + non-streaming, tool use, thinking) |

Anthropic clients authenticate via `x-api-key` (same value as `AUTH_TOKEN`); `anthropic-version` is allowed through CORS.

#### `/v1/chat/completions` body

| Field | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `model` | string | `glm-5` | Any ID from `/v1/models` |
| `messages` | array | *(required)* | OpenAI-style; `content` may be a string or parts with `text`/`image_url` |
| `stream` | bool | `true` | SSE stream when true |
| `reasoning` | bool | *(per-model)* | Enables `enable_thinking` |
| `thinking` | object | *(per-model)* | `{"type":"enabled"}` / `{"type":"disabled"}` → `enable_thinking` |
| `reasoning_effort` | string | *(empty)* | `"high"`/`"max"` — forwarded only if the model supports it; forces `enable_thinking=true` |
| `tools` | array | *(empty)* | OpenAI-style tools (requires agent mode) |
| `webSearch` / `search` | bool | *(per-model)* | Toggle the WebSearch feature (sets `auto_web_search` in the upstream `features` payload) |
| `advancedSearch` | bool | `false` | **Advanced Search** (chat.z.ai's MCP variant of web search) — adds `"mcp_servers":["advanced-search"]` to the upstream completions payload; implies `webSearch=true` |

#### Image input (vision)

Both endpoints accept images. The bridge extracts every image, uploads it to Z.AI (`POST /api/v1/files/`), and attaches the returned file objects as a top-level `files` array — the same payload the official web client sends. Message text is forwarded as usual; the pixels ride in `files`.

- **OpenAI** — `image_url` parts, remote URL or base64 data URL:
  ```json
  {"role":"user","content":[
    {"type":"text","text":"What is in this image?"},
    {"type":"image_url","image_url":{"url":"https://example.com/photo.jpg"}},
    {"type":"image_url","image_url":{"url":"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw..."}}
  ]}
  ```
- **Anthropic** — `image` blocks, `base64` or `url` source:
  ```json
  {"role":"user","content":[
    {"type":"text","text":"What is in this image?"},
    {"type":"image","source":{"type":"base64","media_type":"image/png","data":"iVBORw..."}},
    {"type":"image","source":{"type":"url","url":"https://example.com/photo.jpg"}}
  ]}
  ```

**Limits:** max **10 images / 50 MB each** per request — exceeding either returns `400` before any upload. Images are held in memory only (no temp files). Use a vision-capable model (`architecture.input_modalities`); images on a non-vision model log a warning and forward anyway.

> ⚠️ **Requires a real account (`ZAI_TOKEN`).** The `/api/v1/files/` upload endpoint only accepts a logged-in token. On a guest session, model listing and text completions still work, but uploads are rejected with `401` and the request fails with `400 {"message":"image processing failed: file upload unauthorized (401)"}`. Images are uploaded per request (never cached/deduplicated) and are not deleted by the bridge afterwards.

#### `/v1/messages` body

Standard Anthropic fields: `model`, `messages`, `system`, `max_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_p`, `stop_sequences`, `stream`, `thinking`, `tools`, `reasoning_effort`. `tool_use`/`tool_result` blocks translate to/from OpenAI format internally (tool calls require agent mode). Image blocks convert to OpenAI `image_url` parts and use the shared vision pipeline.

#### Request headers

| Header | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Authorization: Bearer <AUTH_TOKEN>` | OpenAI-style auth |
| `x-api-key: <AUTH_TOKEN>` | Anthropic-style auth |
| `Include-All-Features: true` | (Only `POST /features`) send all server capabilities to `/completions` |

### Management

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET`  | `/` | ❌ | Redirects to `/health` |
| `GET`  | `/health` | ❌ | `200` if initialised, else `503` — now also carries a real-time `tokenCount` from the active token DB (below) |
| `GET`  | `/status` | ❌ | Live session status (connected, userName, userId, feVersion, features, mode, sessionPool) |
| `GET`  | `/admin/health` | ❌ | Same as `/health` |
| `GET`  | `/admin/stats` | ❌ | Mode, totalClients, totalRequests |
| `GET`  | `/admin/clients` | ❌ | Client list |
| `POST` | `/features` | ✅ | Per-model feature overrides (below) |
| `GET`  | `/features` | ✅ | Inspect resolved features / stored states |
| `POST` | `/sqlite` | ✅ | **Hot-swap the active token database** without restarting (below) |
| `POST` | `/stop` | ✅ | Acknowledged no-op |

---

## `/health` — Real-Time Token Count

The health response includes the number of device tokens left in the active `tokens.sqlite`:

```json
{ "healthy": true, "mode": "direct", "tokenCount": 1500 }
```

- The count is served from a small TTL cache (`TOKEN_COUNT_TTL_MS`, default **5000** ms) so frequent health probes don't turn into per-probe `SELECT COUNT(*)` queries.
- `-1` means "unknown": no database attached, or the count query failed (e.g. the file vanished).
- Swapping the database (`POST /sqlite`) invalidates the cache immediately — the next probe reflects the new file, not a stale value.

## WAF Circuit Breaker (issue #41)

Sustained agent traffic can trip the Aliyun WAF in front of chat.z.ai: the **egress IP** gets served the block page on `POST /api/v2/chat/completions` even though `GET /` and `GET /api/models` keep working. The block is IP-wide (a real browser on the same IP fails identically) and outlives any single request.

The bridge now handles this end-to-end:

- **Shared pacing gate** — every upstream transport (Z.AI client + Aliyun captcha client) funnels through *one* process-wide slot allocator, so the minimum gap between consecutive upstream requests holds no matter which transport fires. Previously each transport paced independently, and interleaved captcha/completion/delete calls could collapse the real gap to zero.
- **Block detection** — the block page (405/403 + the Aliyun marker HTML) is recognized and distinguished from genuine Z.AI JSON errors.
- **Fail fast** — while the breaker is open, requests are rejected with `503` + `Retry-After` **before** a pooled session is drawn, before vision upload, and above all **before a captcha burns a harvested device token**. Chat deletions are skipped too, so a block no longer generates pointless upstream traffic that keeps it alive.
- **Background recovery** — a prober re-checks the blocked endpoint after each cooldown, **doubling the backoff** (60 s → 30 min cap) while the block persists, and resumes traffic automatically the moment it lifts. The probe deliberately targets `POST /api/v2/chat/completions` (bare, unauthenticated, no captcha) — the endpoint the WAF actually blocks — not a path that stays open during a block.
- **Clean client errors** — clients receive a small structured JSON error (`{"type":"overloaded_error","code":"waf_block","retryIn":"35s"}`) with a `Retry-After` header, never the raw 3 KB HTML page:

```json
{ "error": { "type": "overloaded_error", "code": "waf_block",
    "message": "chat.z.ai has temporarily blocked this server's IP (Aliyun WAF). ...",
    "retryIn": "35s" } }
```

`GET /status` exposes live breaker state:

```json
"waf": { "blocked": true, "state": 1, "retryIn": "43s", "consecutiveBlocks": 3 }
```

## `/sqlite` — Hot-Swap the Token Database

Point the running bridge at a freshly harvested `tokens.sqlite` **without restarting** (restart would drop every in-flight request and the session pool):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/sqlite \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"db_path": "/new/path/tokens.sqlite"}'
```

Response:

```json
{ "success": true, "message": "database swapped", "db_path": "/new/path/tokens.sqlite",
  "swapped_in": "35ms", "token_count": 1500 }
```

**Validation happens before anything live is touched.** A candidate file is rejected with `400` + a precise error if it: doesn't exist, is a directory, isn't readable, isn't a valid SQLite database, or lacks the expected `tokens` (id, token, batch) schema. A rejected candidate never disturbs the active database.

**The swap is graceful by construction:**

1. The candidate is validated and opened via its own private connection first — the live swap itself is a single pointer exchange (tens of ms end-to-end including open + ping).
2. In-flight requests keep the database handle they captured and finish normally against the old file; the retired handle is closed only after its in-flight count drains to zero.
3. Requests arriving *during* the swap are **throttled** (they wait for the microseconds the write lock is held) and then see the new database — nothing is denied or failed mid-swap.
4. Concurrent `POST /sqlite` calls are serialised; the second gets an explicit "swap already in progress — retry shortly" error.

Repeated swaps to the same path are supported (the collector may have rewritten the file in place).

---

## `/features` — Per-Model Feature Configuration

Features resolve **per model**: start from the model's server capabilities → if `IncludeAll` is set, include all capabilities except `reasoning_effort` (a support flag, not a feature) → apply stored per-model overrides → `enable_thinking` defaults `true` unless overridden. `think` is never included (only `enable_thinking` reaches the request), `reasoning_effort` is never stored (per-request only), and **`image_generation` is always forced `false`**.

**`GET /features`** — without query returns all per-model states; with `?model=<id>` returns the resolved `features`, stored `includeAll`/`overrides`, and raw `capabilities`:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer Waguri" http://localhost:3001/features
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer Waguri" "http://localhost:3001/features?model=glm-4.7"
```

**`POST /features`** — body must contain `model`; any other key is a feature override (camelCase auto-converts to snake_case):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/features \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer Waguri" \
  -d '{"model":"glm-4.7","enable_thinking":false}'
```

| Special key | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `reasoning` (bool) | stored as `enable_thinking` |
| `thinking` (bool or `{"type":"enabled"}`) | stored as `enable_thinking` |
| `image_generation` | ignored — always `false` |
| `think` | ignored — use `enable_thinking`/`reasoning`/`thinking` |
| `reasoning_effort` | not stored — per-request only |

To enable **all** server capabilities for a model (testing), add the header `Include-All-Features: true` to the POST.

---

## Agent Mode

Z.AI's unofficial `/api/v2/chat/completions` only accepts `role="user"` messages — system/assistant/tool roles and OpenAI `tools`/`tool_calls` all cause `INTERNAL_ERROR`. With agent mode on (`--agent-mode` / `AGENT_MODE=true`), the bridge folds roles & tools into a user-only prompt and converts the model's `<<<TOOL_CALL>>>` output back into native `tool_calls` deltas (OpenAI) / `tool_use` blocks (Anthropic) with `finish_reason="tool_calls"` / `stop_reason="tool_use"`. **Agent mode is required for tool-calling to work** — without it, `tools` in the body are ignored. The hosted instance already runs it.

**Modern shim (default, recommended)** — folds the whole conversation + tool contract into **one XML-sectioned user message**: `<system>` (output contract), `<tools>` (definitions), a filled-in example call built from the request's first tool, `<history_summary>` (older tool exchanges summarized — anti context-rot), `<recent>` (last 6 exchanges verbatim in `<tool_exchange>` groups), `<already_called>` (deduplicated list of calls already made — anti-loop, issue #31), `<current_task>`, `<output_rules>` (the contract repeated verbatim at the tail — recency). The `<system>` contract is deliberately strict and short (issue #44): the literal block is shown on its own lines in both the head and tail sections, the parser is described as a literal scanner whose only recognized spellings are those exact byte strings, and the derailment shapes observed in the wild (`TOOL_CALL_BLOCK`, renamed markers, fenced blocks) are explicitly named discarded — paraphrasing means the tool never runs. The parser itself keeps its own tolerance (markers matched with 2–4 angle brackets, ` ```json ` fences stripped, flat/alternate payloads normalized). The fallback parsers that used to chain behind it — Zhipu's native tag dialect, envelope-less bare invocations, and a stream-end re-extraction pass over the full text — were **removed**: the strict literal contract makes the model emit exactly the block above, so the default parser alone is sufficient and the fallbacks were pure complexity.

**Streamed tool calls** — with `stream: true`, tool calls stream live like the OpenAI/Anthropic APIs: as soon as a block's `{"name": …, "arguments": {` has arrived, the client receives the header delta (`index`, `id`, `type`, `function.name`), then incremental `function.arguments` fragments (`input_json_delta` on Anthropic) while the model is still writing the JSON, closing with `finish_reason="tool_calls"` / `stop_reason="tool_use"`. There is no silent buffer window between the markers. Non-streamable shapes (arguments as a JSON-encoded string, flat payloads) still emit one complete buffered call; fragments are rune-safe, so markers and multi-byte characters split across upstream SSE chunks never garble or leak.

**Legacy shim (opt-in)** — `--agent-mode-variant=legacy` / `AGENT_MODE_VARIANT=legacy`: prepends a system-prefix user message, rewrites every non-user message as `[ROLE: <role>] ...`, and renders tools into a strict `<<<TOOL_CALL>>> {"name":...,"arguments":{...}} <<<END_TOOL_CALL>>>` contract.

**Ultra repair (opt-in beta, issue #44)** — `--agent-mode --agent-mode-level=ultra`: when long-horizon sessions rot the model's output and it emits a paraphrased envelope (`TOOL_CALL_BLOCK`, `<tool_call>`, fenced or flat payloads…) instead of the canonical block, a small Text-to-Tool-Call model (ToolParserLLM: Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct + LoRA adapter) repairs it. Pipeline per response: buffer the stream → validate against the canonical format → valid blocks pass through untouched (the repair model is never consulted) → each malformed span is isolated (surrounding prose excluded), de-noised, VAR-patched for long values (spans ≥150 chars, or ≥50 with a newline, become `VARn` sentinels and are rehydrated verbatim after), and sent to the model with the canonical spec → its output is re-validated before splicing; on any failure the original fragment is forwarded with a warning, never silently dropped. Repair is idempotent and per-span independent; every event is logged (original / extracted / model output / decision). Dormant otherwise: without *both* flags nothing is loaded, warmed up, or referenced, and default + plain `--agent-mode` behavior is byte-for-byte unchanged.

Model serving: at ultra startup the bridge downloads the base-model reference and the LoRA bundle (public Kaggle dataset `zoxoashouko/v28-flagship-toolparser`: `adapter_model.safetensors` + `adapter_config.json`), verifies integrity (non-empty zip, optional pinned SHA256, weights+config present and valid JSON), caches under `TOOLPARSER_LLM_CACHE_DIR`, and loads base+LoRA via SGLang. GPU hosts serve automatically; CPU-only hosts abort with an actionable error unless `--force-cpu` / `FORCE_CPU=1` is passed (documented degraded path — slow, may exceed agent timeouts). Failures are loud: bad checksum, incomplete bundle, or an SGLang that never becomes ready all abort startup with what to check. `TOOLPARSER_LLM_LORA_PATH` / `TOOLPARSER_LLM_BASE_PATH` allow fully local/air-gapped setups.

Enabling agent mode also starts the background captcha cache (2 pre-generated params, 75 s TTL, pauses after 3 min idle).

## Web Search & Advanced Search (issue #42)

Two separate things live behind the globe icon on chat.z.ai, and the bridge now maps both onto request flags:

**WebSearch** (`webSearch: true`, or the `search` alias) — the model's built-in search mode. Internally this sets **`auto_web_search: true`** in the upstream `features` payload. That is the only key that actually toggles the feature: the sibling `web_search` key is **always `false` upstream** — sending `true` there does nothing (the server just mirrors it back), which is why a request that "looked" enabled could silently do nothing. The bridge now always pins `features.web_search = false` and never sends `true` for it, no matter what stored overrides say.

**Advanced Search** (`advancedSearch: true`) — not a feature flag at all, but an **MCP server**. On the real chat.z.ai web, toggling Advanced Search makes the frontend add a new top-level field to the completions request payload:

```json
{
  "model": "glm-5.3",
  "chat_id": "...",
  "messages": [...],
  "captcha_verify_param": "...",
  "mcp_servers": ["advanced-search"],
  "features": { "auto_web_search": true, ... }
}
```

`mcp_servers` sits on the same payload level as `captcha_verify_param` (it is *not* inside `features`). When it's present, Z.AI runs the model's searches through the advanced-search MCP tools — the internal `tool_call` events (`retrieve`, `open_url`, …) you see fly by in the SSE stream are that loop at work; they're answered server-side by Z.AI itself and have nothing to do with agent-mode tool calling.

The bridge reproduces this exactly: `advancedSearch: true` adds `"mcp_servers": ["advanced-search"]` to the upstream payload and auto-enables the base web-search toggle (same coupling as the web UI, where Advanced Search hides behind the globe). Citations come back inline as `【turn0search0】` markers in the message text plus `[ref_id=...]` blocks the model quotes from — the `metadata.browser.search_result` on the internal tool responses carries the full source list (title, url, snippet, favicon) for anyone who wants to build a references panel.

**Agent-mode gate** — when agent mode is on, both search toggles are **force-disabled server-side**, even if the request asks for them. Z.AI serves WebSearch through its own internal tool-call loop; mixing that with the agent shim's tool contract makes the model emit internal markers (`retrieve`, `open_url`) as if they were the caller's tools, or refuse to search at all. The request still succeeds — it just runs without server-side search. If you need both, run tool-calling requests without the search flags and let the client's own tools fetch pages.

Both flags are also accepted on the Anthropic `/v1/messages` endpoint (`webSearch`, `search`, `advancedSearch` in the body) and map to the same upstream payload.

## Examples

> Self-hosted examples use `glm-4.7` so they work **without** `ZAI_TOKEN`. For the hosted instance use base URL `https://glm.cognix.sryze.cc/v1`, model `glm-5.2` or `glm-5.3-flash`, same auth.

```bash
# OpenAI — non-streaming
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer Waguri" \
  -d '{"model":"glm-4.7","stream":false,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello, who are you?"}]}'

# OpenAI — streaming with deep thinking
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:3001/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer Waguri" \
  -d '{"model":"glm-4.7","stream":true,"reasoning":true,"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Summarize today'\''s top AI news."}]}'

# Anthropic — streaming with thinking (primitive on hosted; OpenAI recommended)
curl -N -X POST http://localhost:3001/v1/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "x-api-key: Waguri" -H "anthropic-version: 2023-06-01" \
  -d '{"model":"glm-4.7","max_tokens":4096,"stream":true,"thinking":{"type":"enabled"},"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Explain quantum entanglement."}]}'
```

```python
# Python — OpenAI SDK (self-hosted shown; hosted: base_url="https://glm.cognix.sryze.cc/v1", model="glm-5.3-flash" or "glm-5.2")
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI(base_url="http://localhost:3001/v1", api_key="Waguri")
resp = client.chat.completions.create(model="glm-4.7", messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}])
print(resp.choices[0].message.content)

# Python — Anthropic SDK
from anthropic import Anthropic
client = Anthropic(base_url="http://localhost:3001", api_key="Waguri")
resp = client.messages.create(model="glm-4.7", max_tokens=1024, messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}])
print(resp.content[0].text)
```

## How It Works

1. **Session init** — startup calls Z.AI `/api/v1/auths/guest` (+ `/api/v1/auths/`) for a JWT, or uses `ZAI_TOKEN`; the frontend version (`prod-fe-x.y.z`) is scraped from the homepage.
2. **Captcha** — per request, an Aliyun `captcha_verify_param` is generated in-memory: `InitCaptchaV3` → `certifyId`; `arg` via RC4-like permutation cipher (KSA + PRGA over a 64-byte state); `Track` JSON + custom `ali_hash` (16-byte-state hash), zlib-compress, base64-encode, then a second RC4-like `encrypt` pass (different key); `VerifyCaptchaV3` with a pooled device token → `securityToken`; final `{certifyId, isSign, sceneId, securityToken}` base64-encoded. Tokens come FIFO from `tokens.sqlite` and are deleted after use (up to 5 retries). Hard 90 s timeout → `500` on failure.
3. **Signature** — HMAC-SHA256 over `(sortedPayload | promptBase64 | timestamp)` with a salted bucket key from `SALT_KEY` and `timestamp / 300000`.
4. **Streaming** — POST `/api/v2/chat/completions` with `stream:true`; parses SSE (`edit_content` + `edit_index`, `delta_content`, `content`, or OpenAI-style deltas) and re-emits as OpenAI/Anthropic SSE. Semantics mirror the official `prod-fe` bundle: `edit_content` replaces from `edit_index` (a **UTF-16 code-unit offset**, missing = 0 = full replace), `content` = full replace, `delta_content` = append. Deltas are cut on rune boundaries with a `STREAM_HOLDBACK` tail so backtracks never surface as garble (issue #23). Inline errors (HTTP 200 + `data.error`) are surfaced; on `401` the session re-initialises and retries once.
5. **Session GC** — each chat is reused up to `SESSION_REUSE_COUNT` then deleted in the background (async mode restocks the pool; sync mode rotates the sticky chat). Shutdown clears all pooled/sticky sessions. See [Session Lifecycle](#session-lifecycle--reused-sessions--the-session-pool).

## Token Collection (`cmd/token-collector`)

Seeds `tokens.sqlite` with device tokens harvested from `chat.z.ai` via Playwright, with a Bubble Tea TUI (progress bar, live logs, spinner).

```bash
go build -ldflags="-s -w" -trimpath -o token-collector ./cmd/token-collector   # portable
# modern CPUs, fully static: CGO_ENABLED=0 GOAMD64=v3 go build -ldflags="-s -w" -trimpath -o token-collector ./cmd/token-collector
./token-collector                        # interactive TUI prompts
./token-collector --tokens 750 --batch 3 # specific configuration
./token-collector --parallel 3 --headed  # parallel workers, visible browser
```

| Flag | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `--unsafe` | `false` | Raise limits: tokens 1500, batches 25, parallel 5 |
| `--tokens` | `0` | Tokens per batch (0 = prompt; default 850, max 1500) |
| `--batch` | `0` | Batches (0 = prompt; default 5, max 9 / 25 unsafe) |
| `--parallel` | `0` | Parallel pages on one browser (0 = prompt; max 3 / 5 unsafe) |
| `--headed` | `false` | Show browser window |
| `--block-trackers` | `false` | URL allowlist blocking tracker/analytics requests |
| `--no-tui` | `false` | Plain text output |

Implementation: pure-Go SQLite (WAL, 64 MB page cache, 256 MB mmap); one page per worker kept open across batches; parallel batches on a single browser; `GOGC=200`; lock-free atomics for abort/total; TUI ring buffer (1000 lines, scroll ↑/↓ g/G); allowlist permits only `chat.z.ai`, z-cdn assets, Aliyun captcha scripts, and `cloudauth-device`.

## Notes

- The default auth token (`Waguri`) is a placeholder — set `AUTH_TOKEN` in production.
- Device tokens are **consumed and deleted** after use — re-run the token collector to replenish (each captcha tries up to 5 tokens).
- `--verbose` only controls the captcha subsystem's logging; standard bridge/SSE logging is gated by `LOG_LEVEL=debug`.
- Each request gets a fresh `chat_id` — no server-side conversation persistence; the chat is deleted right after the response completes.
